                            <p>This subject will introduce the integration of IoT systems into cloud architectures from
                                a technical perspective.</p>
                            <p>It will cover the data communication protocols used between devices and platforms
                                including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Low bandwidth IoT edge protocol such as LoRaWAN</li>
                                <li>Machine-to-machine protocols and integrations</li>
                                <li>RESTful API, an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that
                                    uses
                                    HTTP requests to access and use data</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Students will be encouraged to qualify for certification on a
                                cloud-based platform.</p>
                            <p>The second part of this subject will cover how to propose an idea with both
                                technological advantages and business opportunities, how to write a grant
                                application to attract
                                business investors, and how to quickly develop prototypes of their new inventions
                                with an enterprise
                                IoT platform. Overall, this subject endeavours to boost students' innovation and
                                business skills and
                                nurture their commercial aspirations.
